# Quran-Hadith-Islam

After more than 12 years of computerized research of Quran, PHYSICAL EVIDENCE was discovered proving that Quran is indeed the infallible word of ALLAH.

The continued research then unveiled a startling fact; that the extremely popular ''Hadith & Sunna'' have nothing to do with the prophet Muhammad, and that adherence thereto represents flagrant disobedience of ALLAH and HIS messengers (Quran 6:112 & 25:31).

This finding contradicts the beliefs of Muslim masses everywhere. As it turned out, telling the Muslims that ''Hadith & Sunna'' are Satanic inventions is the same as telling the Christians that Jesus is not the son of God.

Since the recognition of ''Hadith & Sunna'' as Satanic innovations is supported by PHYSICAL EVIDENCE, all freethinking people will accept the findings reported in this book. For such people, the results include a totally new sense of salvation, and full awareness that the Muslim masses have fallen victim to Satan's schemes.
